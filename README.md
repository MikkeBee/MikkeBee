- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael, but I usually go by Mikke. Either name works for me!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and designing. My goal is to contribute something useful to the world, not just make pretty stuff. Though that's fun, too!
- 🌱 I’m a frontend-leaning fullstack developer. 
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm work with a bit of everything: React Native, React, Next.js, Gatsby, Svelte, Flutter, and if I really have to then also PHP.
- 🖌 I'm interested in making stuff, especially things that look cool, and learning. My philosophy is never stop learning. 
- 💻 I have a background in project management, marketing, events management, Salesforce and Marketing Cloud CRMs, and even a bit of graphic design. 
- 📫 Contact me or stalk me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjblakley87/)
