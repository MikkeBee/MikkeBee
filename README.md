- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mikke!
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in coding and designing. My goal is to contribute something useful to the world, not just make pretty stuff. Though that's fun, too!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently a front-end developer at Arnolds. Working toward MERN full stack proficiency. 
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª I'm working mostly with React Native / React. I've also started playing around with Storybook. 
- üñå I'm interested in CSS animation and making things look cool. Still at the starting stages though.
- üíª I have a background in project management, marketing, events management, Salesforce and Marketing Cloud CRMs, and even a bit of graphic design. 
- üì´ Michael.blakley@edu.bc.fi is my school email. Contact me for my private email. Or stalk me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjblakley87/)
