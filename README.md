- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mikke
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in coding and designing. My goal is to contribute something useful to the world, not just make pretty websites. Though that's fun, too!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently studying to be a full-stack web developer.
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Many of my projects, especially older ones, have commented-out text and notes. As I am still studying, I want to keep these in, as they are valuable learning materials for me. Hopefully the further I progress in school, the fewer notes and examples I will need to keep.
- üñå I'm interested in CSS animation and making things look cool. Still at the starting stages though.
- üíª I have a background in project management, marketing, events management, Salesforce and Marketing Cloud CRMs, and even a bit of graphic design. 
- üì´ Michael.blakley@edu.bc.fi is my school email. Contact me for my private email. Or stalk me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjblakley87/)
